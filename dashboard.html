    <h1>Government Spending In Kentucky During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
    <h3>This dashboard holds the visualizations 
      for my data analysis on government spending 
      during the pandemic in the state of Kentucky.
    </h3>
    <h4> The most interesting pattern I found from my 
      visualizations is that in contradiction to my original hypothesis
      population does not have as strong as an effect on grants recieved.
      In the bar graph depicting total grants recieved per county, Franklin
      county far outweighs all others. However, in the bar graph depicting
      population for each county, Franklin county has one of the lowest totals.
      I plan to dig deeper into this pattern during my EDA 3.
